The Steeze Store — Fashion E-Commerce Frontend

A modern, conversion-focused clothing store frontend built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and a 3-click WhatsApp checkout flow.

Overview

The Steeze Store is a design-forward ecommerce frontend created specifically for clothing and fashion brands that want a fast, stylish, and frictionless online shopping experience.

This project features a 3-click purchase flow, real-time order logging through the admin backend, smooth animations, dark mode, and an elegant product browsing experience—optimized for mobile and desktop users.

This repository contains the full frontend implementation built using modern React tooling and a scalable design system.
